# Tyranosaurus - Desktop Apps with Deno

This is my attempt at making a minimalistic Electron/Neutralino-like framework for making desktop apps with Deno.

This started as the backend of my other project, the Birb Engine. A game engine for Deno focused on making desktop games. But in the process of making the backend test-friendly, I realized that it could just as well be a more general API, which could be used by itself.

Now I have two projects! :D

I decided to name it Tyranosaurus. Because why not!
