# Tyranosaurus - Desktop Apps with Deno

This is my attempt at making a minimalistic Electron/Neutralino-like framework for making desktop apps with Deno.

Like Neutralino, it uses the webengine already on the user's machine. So it doesn't bundle Chromium. But unlike Neutralino, it doesn't use its own runtime, instead using Deno's. Therefore the API is very minimal, by desing. And you can use Deno's API's for things like using the filesystem.

This started as the backend of my other project, [the Birb Engine](https://github.com/JorchRL/Birb-Engine-Desktop3D-with-Deno). A 3D game engine for Deno focused on making desktop games. But in the process of making the backend test-friendly, I realized that it could just as well be a more general API, which could be used by itself.

Now I have two projects! :D

I decided to name it Tyranosaurus. Because why not!

## Quick example

Run the `example.ts` file with `$ deno task example`. And then open the dev tools and try:

```
tyrannosaurus.navigate("https://google.com")
```

This framework will inject an API under the `window.tyrannosaurus` object of any page that is loaded.


## Usage

NOTE: it is not ready yet.

The intent is to have an `App` class that can run a webview client and a server. Then you can just write your program and use `appInstance.run()` to start the webview.

You can also register events to run injected JavaScript in the webview, and run Deno callbacks from your web app using an injected API under a `Tyrannosaurus` global object. Something like `Tyrannosaurus.exit()` could be called from your client app, which will run stuff on the backend. 

There should also be a "backend server" that can server files and handle any request you want. So you can, for example `fetch()` from localhost, without problems. I am thinking of also implementing Websocket-based messaging.

## Advantages

Unlike Electron, your app won't bundle Chromium. And unlike Neutralino, you can use Deno's API. And pretty much any Node package, if you import them from an ESM-friendly CDN!

And unlike both of them, the API is intended to be very minimal. So that may be an advantage or disadvantage, depending how you look at it :D

## Todo

- [ ] Export a single namespace `Tyrannosaurus` for the library
- [ ] Write a set of integration tests for the `Application` class, which is the main entrypoint
- [ ] Write a set of tests for the `Client` class.
- [ ] Re-work folder structure. Several of the modules I have right now may not be necessary.
- [ ] Design the client-side API under the same `Tyrannosaurus` namespace
- [ ] Decide on a way to inject the client API when initializing the webview (ie with `webview.bind()`)
- [ ] Implement a localhost file server under the `Server` class. And write some tests.

Note: the `webview.bind()` way of doing things is an alternative to using websockets from a localhost to achieve the same thing. It seems more straight-forward to me. But I may implement the websocket approach later as an alternative.

## Class overview

- `Application` - the main entrypoint. An application instance should hold a `client` reference.
- `Client` - a wrapper class for the `Webview` class of the webview library. `Client` should also bind the client-side API of the library under `window.tyrannosaurus`.
- `Server` - a simple file server so that we can `fetch()` from localhost without issues.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, thanks! I would appreciate ideas, suggestions and issues. I would not encourage PRs yet as things are still changing very fast. I don't want people working on stuff that may not make it.

If you want to share some resources I could learn from please do! I am pretty new to software still and eager to learn.
